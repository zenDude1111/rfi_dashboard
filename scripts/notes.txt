The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test for Normality:

The K-S test is a non-parametric test that compares the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed data 
with the CDF of a specified theoretical distribution (in this case, the normal distribution). The test calculates the 
D statistic, which is the maximum difference between the two CDFs across all possible values. 

The process involves:
1. Calculating the empirical CDF of the observed data.
2. Calculating the CDF of a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the observed data.
3. Finding the maximum absolute difference (D statistic) between these two CDFs.
4. Computing a p-value based on the D statistic, which indicates the probability of observing such a difference 
   if the observed data actually followed the specified normal distribution.

A low p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the observed data significantly deviate from the normal distribution, 
indicating that the distribution of the data is not normal. Conversely, a high p-value suggests that the data could 
plausibly have come from a normal distribution, although it does not confirm normality outright.

This test is applied to each frequency's power readings in the dataset to assess the normality of their distribution. 
It provides a systematic method to identify deviations from normality, which can be critical for analyses assuming 
normal distribution of the data.

Note: While the K-S test is useful for assessing normality, it's important to consider its limitations. 
The test is more sensitive to differences near the center of the distribution than at the tails. 
Additionally, the test's efficacy might be reduced for very small or very large samples.
